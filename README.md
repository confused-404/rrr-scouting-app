# RRR Scouting App

## high priority
when adding data through admin view, it doesnt save

how to change rating 

non admins shouldnt be able to change match schedule

fix phone viewing

add team names

import match schedule

make it so that admins can see multiple autos if multiple autos added

match strategy (look at 3 teams data simultaneously)

team lookup

also have one big pick list

make everything in picklist manually editable

make buttons on dashboard look better (align them)

manually create scouting teams and automatically assign them to shiffts of scouting one slot (eg. red 1)
    - let us enter desired shift length by number of matches

make data analysis better

super scouting notes won't show up for a team if no normal notes are present

## low priority
data analysis graph generator: 
    -x axis should be time (during a regional or across the season)
    -plot only selected teams (let us enter unlimited team numbers which get plotted against each other) and have an option to plot all teams at the regional
    -y axis should have all the current options from both the x and y axis dropdowns (excluding team number and match number)
